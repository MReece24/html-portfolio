<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>An Austin, Texas native with a passion for helping people.  I spent over 20 years in the healthcare industry working my
  way from a front desk position to learning and performing cardiac sonogrpahy and cardiovasclar stress testing for a large 
  Cardiology practice. After six years there, I moved to a large Internal Medicine practice until the Covid-19 pandemic hit.
  During my career, I participated in the care and treatment of thousands of patients and each one left a lasting impact on me. 
  I was priviledged to manage an accredited lab, and I was honored to assist the clinic manager with G-pro reporting and chart 
  review for our efforts with our ACO. I also formed and co-chaired our customer service committee that was responsible for 
  training employees on provding the best possible patient experience. I have also performed consulting services for a small
  advanced imaging center.

<p>In 2013, after several years of helping manage a few family-owned investment properties and participating in a rehab/flip 
  project, I ontained my license to sell real estate in Texas. I started my real estate career with Coldwell Banker United in 
  Round Rock, Texas and learned so much from the senior agents and supervising Broker. I changed sponsoring Brokers in 2019 when 
  my supervising Broker and her husband opened their own boutique firm.  I enjoyed a brief stint working as a Market Sales 
  Manager for Zillow Offers from 2021 to 2022 when I was laid off due to Zillow closing the ZO department.  While with Zillow, I 
  successfully negotiated close to $30 million in sales volume and kept my Repair concession amount to 1% of Sales Price KPI. I 
  enjoyed the fast-paced, team environment as well as cross-collaboration with the asset management, renovation and acquisition
  teams.

<p>I have always had an interest in computer science and while a senior in high school, I wanted to become a Microsoft Certified 
  Systems Engineer. I got laid off from the computer store that I was working at. My father worked in tech as an Electrical Engineer
  working on BGA board repair; he holds several patents for this process. When he was laid off 2 days after I was, I decided that 
  Tech was too unstable for me and changed to the healthcare industry. Now in 2024, I am working on my "second career" in learning
  to become a full-stack web developer.
