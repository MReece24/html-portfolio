<h1>Matt's Favorite Movies</h1>

<h2>Not a complete list by any means, and in no particular order</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Gone in Sixty Seconds</h3>
<p>While some of the acting isn't the best, there are a lot of great action scenes and some beautiful cars.</p>

<h3>Mr. & Mrs. Smith</h3>
<p>Great comedy with an "unexpected" twist</p>

<h3>Rules of Attraction</h3>
<p>Dark movie about college, dating, life and teenage angst.  Some comedy sprinkled in for good measure</p>

<h3>James Bond</h3>
<p>I know they are old and mostly out of touch with current times, but I enjoy most of the films in the franchise.  I think a lot of that comes from the nostalgia of wathcing them with my father as a young boy.</p>
